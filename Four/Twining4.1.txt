<span id="countdown">Planetary implosion in $seconds seconds</span>
<<silently>>
    <<repeat 1s>>
        <<set $seconds to $seconds - 1>>
        <<if $seconds gt 0>>

        <</if>>
    <</repeat>>
<</silently>>

2. Passage "Beginnings"

3. Passage "Controls"

You're looking at buttons. Like, old school Wing Commander, you're going to need a manual for this, unlabeled buttons. You can hear your cell phone beeping the warning alerts as you look for something marked throttle.

4. Passage "Lost"

The rumbling lets you know it's too late - that, and the sinking feeling. 
The flames are the last thing you see.
