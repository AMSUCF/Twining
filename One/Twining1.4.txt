TWINING EXERCISE 1.4 - DON'T THINK OF AN ELEPHANT
Uses Chapbook

1.  Passage: "Don't Even Think"

At dawn, the [[Elephant Men->Elephant]] will come for your skull.  But meanwhile, as Uncle Jed always told you, [[the night]] is as long as you want it to be.
 
Just, you know, don't think.  You know.  Of it. 


2.  Passage: "Elephant"

Hyper-intelligent pachydermatoids from an exoplanet we haven't found yet, they are here to avenge humanity’s crimes against the elephants.  Evidently, they will be satisfied with just one trophy.  That would be you.
 
Why they chose you remains a mystery, though it could have something to do with the illegal safari they caught you on.  And that elephant gun with the smoke coming out.
 
The senior Elephant Man asks if you have any [[last words]].


3.  Passage: "last words"

Evidently you don't.


4.  Passage: "the night"

As for instance that first night in the Algarve, when Georges-Marie said, "La, but it is [[so big->Elephant]]!"
 
Meaning the room, or the bed possibly.  But you [[flattered]] yourself.



5.  Passage: "flattered"

"Not the [[Hermes->Elephant]]," Georges-Marie objects.  "It flatters not the slightest.  Goes immediately into wrinkles.  And the gray does nothing for you."
 
This was on the night train to St. Petersburg.  You remember the cocktails with prices in Korean, the waiters in their tricorn hats, the endless fields of [[elephant grass]].


6.  Passage: "elephant grass"

Oh dear.  You meant to say "[[potatoes->Elephant]]."
 
[[Oops->Elephant]].
