1.Table 12

You've almost finished the seating chart for the Bunstables' annual beet roast and Scrabble tournament.  Just two places remain at Table 12. 

In the first seat let's put {cycling link for: "gent", choices: ["someone","Lord Magnavox","Nasty Louie","Cousin Sue"]}.

And on the left, {cycling link for: "lady", choices: ["someone else","Lady Splatt-Simple","Violet Femme","Second Cousin Laraine"]}.

[[Okay then! ->Decision]]

2.Decision

You have seated {gent} next to {lady}.

[if gent === "someone" || lady === "someone else"]
You do realize 'someone' is not an actual person, right?

[if gent === "Lord Magnavox" & lady === "Lady Splatt-Simple"]
They'll SO enjoy reminiscing about how he threw her younger brother from that balloon.

[if gent === "Nasty Louie" & lady === "Violet Femme"]
Now THERE'S a pair.

[if gent === "Cousin Sue" & lady === "Second Cousin Laraine"]
Hm.  Yes.  Well.
