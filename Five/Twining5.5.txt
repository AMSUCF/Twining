Lecture Hall

<p>
Oak paneling, ranked benches, psychic traces of boredom and befuddlement.  At the battered podium a clove cigarette smolders.  The old blackboard could use cleaning.  You can make out some words there:

The door opens enough to admit the Deputy Under-Secretary's owlish mug.  "Private meeting," she informs you.  Behind her you hear various voices saying:

As you attempt to peek in, the Head Writer shouts "SCRAM, KID" and tosses a wad of ill-considered passages in your general direction. "Can't you see we've got an I.F. to finish here?"  As the door slams you hear several voices shouting:

For some reason nobody in here has any clothes on!  Guess nobody told you it's a Naked Lunchroom.  All eyes stare at your mortifying lack of bareness.  As you back out the door you hear some people mutter:

An ancient lightbulb flickers once and dies horribly.  The room is filled with monitory shapes... canopic jars... eldritch apparatus... golf bags.  A voice like an old cigar cries out "GO BACK!"  You are about to do just that when a hand appears, scrawling words across the skin of reality:

It's a cross between one of those revolving restaurants and the bridge of some uncanonical starship.  The waiteroid human takes your drink order and shows you to a console.  You idly thumb some buttons on the LCARS and beam up half the Central Business District.  Voices at nearby tables are saying:
